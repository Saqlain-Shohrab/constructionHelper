# Project Overview

## Introduction
The project exemplifies the use of the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern, ensuring clean separation between the UI, business logic, and data. This approach facilitates maintainability and testability.

## Structural Principles
Adherence to SOLID principles guides the project's structure, promoting scalability, modularity, and robustness, which enhances the overall quality and flexibility of the code.

## Key Features
- Efficient management of offline data and background tasks, critical for applications requiring reliable data availability and performance.
- Mechanisms for refreshing app content to enable smooth data retrieval and synchronization with the server, ensuring seamless user experiences even in offline scenarios.
- Integration of a PDF view with basic PDF features.

## Codebase Organization
The codebase is structured to provide clarity on iOS navigation and the use of container views, demonstrating how to apply these key architectural and design principles in a practical iOS app context.
